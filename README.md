# Password-storage-manager
I wrote this program for myself to understand the use of OOP in Python. Therefore, the encryption and decryption key is stored in a file, which is written to after creating an object of the class. The program retrieves the key from this file to encrypt or decrypt data. The program can be modified to allow each user to input their own key, but, again, I reiterate that I wrote the program for myself for the purpose of OOP practice.
